# Makeblock-Extensions-LCD-with-I2C-Interface-Plus

This Extension is to use a LCD 1602 or 2004 with a I2C interface in mBlock Software.

You should install the NewLiquidCrystal_1.3.4 library first, and later add the extension to mBlock Software. I Test this with the v3.4.11

This a modified Version From the original autor BeforeFly to add more I2C direcctions (0x20 & 0x3F). When I Bought a I2C LCD Module from a chinese web, the I2C addres isn't in the Original Extension By BeforeFly and I modified to works with my I2C Module.


I put a Fritzing schematic to make the connections, and a Arduino Scanner Program to know who is the I2C address. It's very usefull.
