# Makeblock-Extensions-LCD-with-I2C-Interface-Plus

This Extension is to use a LCD 1602 or 2004 with a I2C interface in mBlock Software.

You should install the NewLiquidCrystal_1.3.4 library first.And Later add the extension to Mblock Software. I Test this with the v3.4.11

This a modified Version From the original autor BeforeFly to add more I2C direcctions (0x20 & 0x3F)
